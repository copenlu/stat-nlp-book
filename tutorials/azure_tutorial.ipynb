    "# Setting up stat-nlp-book on Microsoft Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "It's exciting to live in future where you can create your own virtual machine (VM) far away from you, somewhere in a remote server farm, and make it do your bidding, like setting up an environment to have your own private stat-nlp-book. This is exactly what we're going to do with this short tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first:\n",
    "\n",
    "## DISCLAIMER\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is NOT required\n",
    "Be careful when registering with Microsoft Azure. As UCL students you have \\$25 per month to spend there, but to register you need to provide your card number. Be 100% sure you know what you're doing as we're not responsible if you manage to spends too much money there. The free \\$25 should be enough for your standard usage. We're trying to make this tutorial as easy as possible, but interfaces might change, as well as the procedure, so be wary of any deviations and proceed at your own responsability.\n",

In the following screen you will be greated with a request for personal info, including credit card info. Please study this in detail- your credit card should not be charged for this offer unless you explicitly remove the spending limit. However, please re-check everything as we are not responsible if you spend your own money on Azure.\n",

    "After entering your data, you will have to wait a few minutes until Microsoft Azure gets set up (grab some fresh air, Tweet about how you're setting up Azure or check the static stat-nlp-book so you stay on top of everything). When the setup finishes, click on **Start managing my service >** and in a moment you should be seeing Microsoft Azure dashboard.\n",

    "On **Basics** you should set the options like this:\n",
    "- **Name** - name of your VM (e.g. stat-nlp-book)\n",
    "- **VM disk type** - disk type, HDDs are cheaper\n",
    "- **User name** - user name you will use to log in, we'll refer to this as **USER_NAME**\n",
    "- **Authentication type** - it's easier to go with **Password**, but go with **SSH public key** if you know what you're doing\n",
    "- **Password** - your login password\n",
    "- **Subscription** - should be set to **Developer Program Benefit** (your free UCL stuff)\n",
    "- **Resource group** - create a new one, name it whichever way you want (e.g. stat-nlp-book, ucl-stuff, komputrz...)\n",
    "- **Location** - having a Developer Program Benefit, you are limited to specific locations. **West Central US** should give you cheapest option.\n",
