    "# Loading the OHHLA corpus\n",
    "This notebook shows a typical example of data loading and preprocessing necessary for NLP. In this case we are loading a corpus downloaded from the Hip-Hop Lyrics webpage [www.ohhla.com](www.ohhla.com). Our primary goal is to provide a dataset loading function for the [language modelling](todo) chapter in this book.\n",

    "We provide the corpus in the `data` directory. As this notebook lives in a sub-directory itself, we access it via `../data`. Before preprocessing all files and provide *generic* loaders it is useful to inspect the format of the files based on a specific example file, and work on the loading process in this context. Here we look at `/data/ohhla/www.ohhla.com/anonymous/j_live/SPTA/authentc.jlv.txt`.  "
