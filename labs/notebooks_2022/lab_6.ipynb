    "The task is extractive question answering. In this, the data consists of a question, and answer, and the span in the context which contains the correct answer. To model this, we will train our model to simply predict the start and end tokens of the answer. You will improve on this in your project using sequence tagging as opposed to predictincg single start/end answer tokens.\n",

    "**It must be noted** that the goal of the task is to give `2` probabilites(logits) for each of the tokens within the given input *context*. This allows us to end up with a distribution of logits for a `start of the answer` and `end of the answer` tokens akin to the following:\n",

       " 'context': 'Inhaled bronchodilators are the primary medications used, and result in a small overall benefit. The two major types are β2 agonists and anticholinergics; both exist in long-acting and short-acting forms. They reduce shortness of breath, wheeze, and exercise limitation, resulting in an improved quality of life. It is unclear if they change the progression of the underlying disease.In those with mild disease, short-acting agents are recommended on an as needed basis. In those with more severe disease, long-acting agents are recommended. Long-acting agents partly work by reducing hyperinflation. If long-acting bronchodilators are insufficient, then inhaled corticosteroids are typically added. Which type of long-acting agent, tiotropium (a long-acting anticholinergic) or a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) is better is unclear, and trying each and continuing with the one that works best may be advisable. Both types of agent appear to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations by 15–25%. While both may be used at the same time, any added benefit is of questionable significance.Several short-acting β2 agonists are available, including salbutamol (albuterol) and terbutaline. They provide some relief of symptoms for four to six hours. LABAs such as salmeterol, formoterol, and indacaterol are often used as maintenance therapy. Some feel the evidence of benefits is limited, while others view the evidence of benefit as established. Long-term use appears safe in COPD with adverse effects include shakiness and heart palpitations. When used with inhaled steroids they increase the risk of pneumonia. While steroids and LABAs may work better together, it is unclear if this slight benefit outweighs the increased risks. There is some evidence that combined treatment of LABAs with long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), an anticholinergic, may result in less exacerbations, less pneumonia, an improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1%), and potential improvements in quality of life when compared to treatment with LABA and an inhaled corticosteriod (ICS). All three together, LABA, LAMA, and ICS, have some evidence of benefits. Indacaterol requires an inhaled dose once a day, and is as effective as the other long-acting β2 agonist drugs that require twice-daily dosing for people with stable COPD.Two main anticholinergics are used in COPD, ipratropium and tiotropium. Ipratropium is a short-acting agent, while tiotropium is long-acting. Tiotropium is associated with a decrease in exacerbations and improved quality of life, and tiotropium provides those benefits better than ipratropium. It does not appear to affect mortality or the overall hospitalization rate. Anticholinergics can cause dry mouth and urinary tract symptoms. They are also associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Aclidinium, another long-acting agent, reduces hospitalizations associated with COPD and improves quality of life. The LAMA umeclidinium bromide is another anticholinergic alternative. When compared to tiotropium, the LAMAs aclidinium, glycopyrronium, and umeclidinium appear to have a similar level of efficacy; with all four being more effective than placebo. Further research is needed comparing aclidinium to tiotropium.',\n",

Biopsies taken from the complainants were analyzed by Rutgers University biochemists, who found high levels of dioxin, dibenzofuran, and trichloroethylene in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (which governs handling of dangerous materials). They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman Lee H. Hamilton, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told 60 Minutes reporter Lesley Stahl, \"The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit.\"',\n",

    "\n",
    "The next step is running our validation data through the model, getting predictions for the start and end tokens, converting these back into text from the original context, and evaluating using an appropriate metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the absolute best answer span is non-trivial. In the simplest case, we can sort the logits for the start token prediction, sort the logits for the end token prediction, and take the max of each. But the start and end tokens can be predicted anywhere in the input. What if the end is predicted before the start (i.e. the answer is impossible)? We then need a way to determine what is the \"second\" best answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need some way to score the possible valid answers. A valid answer is one where the start token comes before the end token, and the tokens are within the context part of the input. As a scoring function, we will simply add the value of the start token logits with the value of the end token logits. To get candidates, we will then iterate through the highest $N$ scoring logits from the start and end logits, where $N$ is a hyperparameter, determine if the pair is valid, and if so add it to a list of candidate answers. We can then rank all of the candidate answers by their score and take the highest scoring answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to answer text then involves using the same character offset map we used in training to get the start and end character offsets based on the token index. As such, we'll do a similar procedure to get features for the validation samples, this time storing the ID of each sample so we can map them back to the original text, as well as storing the offsets to map back the characters. We don't need to calculate the start and end token positions in this case because we will evaluate the model based on the retrieved answer text."
